# Pathfinding Algorithms
This respatory contains java versions of various pathfinding scripts all written by me. You are free to use them as long as credit is given.

The main point is just for the algoritms themselves so the other code is just to demonstrate it.

# Current Pathfinding Algorithms
- A*

# Keybinds
- Mouse Button 1: Will set/remove the tile (green equals start, red equals end, black equals barrier) also if you click a tile again it removes it
- Enter: Starts/Clears the pathfinding algoritm

# Ideas
- Other Algorithms
- Solving mazes given in image form (you give it an image of a maze and it solves it)
